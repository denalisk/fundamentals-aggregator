# Finance Fundamentals Aggregator

>Sorry, but this project straight up isn't ready to be scrutinized, but I wanted to at least submit a link

#### Basically, I'm using web scraping/crawling to gather finance fundamentals for companies, based on what a user (mainly me) wants to look at. I use this data for value investing personally, and this is streamlining my process.

#### Additionally, I'm expanding the app to crawl publicly traded companies in various industries to pull out cases that might interest me based on specific criteria, and I'm looking into using some Azure services or building my own models to do basic sentiment analysis on news data related to companies.

#### I'm not totally sure news sentiment is a data point I want, unless I can build a killer model, we'll see.

#### Sorry again for the lame link.
